How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used a public API to recieve data when change on the select menu occurs.

API used in two parts of script
 -Received data to fill select menu and create/append them as new elements
 -Called API with beer names when change on the created select list occurs
 
 Lessons Learned:

-Multiple use cases of same API
-Creating new option elements and adding event listeners to them
-Recalling API on created elements with their values to pick correct data from API
